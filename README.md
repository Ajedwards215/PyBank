The assignment involved creating a Python script to analyze a company's financial records provided in a CSV file. The script was required to calculate various financial metrics such as the total number of months included in the dataset, the total net amount of profit/losses over the entire period, the average change in profit/loss over the entire period, and the most significant increase and decrease in profits (with corresponding dates) over the entire period. The resulting script successfully generated these values and displayed them in a readable format. This assignment demonstrates proficiency in Python programming and financial analysis.
